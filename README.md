## [Name Exploration](./whats_in_a_name/what_is_in_a_name.html)

_This is an exploration of a name frequency dataset from the United States from 1910 to 2015. I explore the usage of the names Adam and Brittany, as well as traditional Christian Names Mary, Martha, Peter and Paul. Finally, we look at a couple movies with names in the title, and try to see their impact on names._

## [Flight Delays](./flight_delays/flight_delays.html)

_This is an exploration of FAA data that tracks late flights. After cleaning the missing and incorrect data (using lookups, inferrence, and mean where appropriate), we evaluate the airports to avoid, the months that have the fewest flight delays, and we calculate, tabulate and visualize total weather delays across all airports._

## [Baseball](./baseball/baseball.html)

_This is an exploration of Sean Lahman's baseball database. We look at players who attended BYU-I, at batting averages across individual years as well as across career, and we compare the number of wins per dollar spent for the Seattle Mariners against the Los Angeles Dodgers._

## [Home Predictions](./home_year_built_predictions/home_year_built_predictions.html)
_In this project, we explore the training of an ML model to predict if a home was built pre-1980 based on the other columns. Datasets can be dirty or missing data, and pre-1980 homes may have asbestos. The goal is to provide a trained model that can predict with an accuracy of at least 90% whether a home was built pre/post 1980 based on the other data._

## [Star Wars Fan Survey](./star_wars/star_wars.html)

_This is an exploration of the Star Wars data set. We clean and prepare the data to be put into an ML model to predict income above \$50k/year, we demonstrate which columns are most useful for that prediction, and we demonstrate that the data is still the same by producing charts._
